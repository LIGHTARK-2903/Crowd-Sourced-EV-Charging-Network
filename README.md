# Crowd-Sourced EV Charging Network ðŸš—âš¡

### Overview  
This project tackles one of the key challenges in EV adoption: the lack of accessible charging infrastructure. Our solution leverages crowd-sourcing to create a decentralized network of EV chargers, allowing users to find, book, and utilize charging points owned by individuals or small businesses.

### Features  
- **Crowd Participation**: Users can register their chargers and earn by sharing.  
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Locate nearby chargers using an interactive map.  
- **Scheduling**: Pre-book charging slots to avoid waiting.  
- **Sustainability**: Supports renewable energy-powered chargers like solar or wind-based systems.  

### Technologies Used  
- **Frontend**: [Flutter/React Native/HTML & CSS]  
- **Backend**: [Node.js/Django/Flask]  
- **Database**: [Firebase/PostgreSQL/MongoDB]
