This is our project of "Crowd Sourced EV Charging Network"

We have created a basic knowledge about how this can make your life easy and a shared EV charging network where everyday people and small businesses can list their EV chargers for others to use. Instead of waiting for the government or big companies to set up charging stations, we let individuals with chargers join the network. Think of it like Airbnb but for EV chargers—making charging easier without needing to build expensive new infrastructure.

It will help People: 

~ For EV Owners: They can find chargers anywhere, even in smaller towns, on highways, or in remote areas, reducing the stress of running out of battery (called "range anxiety").

~ For Charger Owners: People with chargers can earn money by letting others use them, like a shop or home offering charging.

~ For Everyone: Promotes the use of clean energy like solar-powered chargers, making EVs more affordable and accessible, and helping the environment by reducing pollution.

It uses a crowd-sourced model instead of relying on big companies or governments. By tapping into chargers already owned by people:

~ No new infrastructure is needed.
~ It works anywhere—cities, villages, highways, or tourist spots.
~ It’s flexible and scalable because anyone with a charger can join.
~ This makes EV adoption faster and more practical for everyone.


Future implemntation : Real-Time Tracking and Scheduling APP

~ The app shows all available chargers nearby, just like Zomato shows restaurants.

~ Users can book a time slot to avoid waiting. For instance, a delivery driver in Ahmedabad could pre-book charging at a local shop while taking a break.
