            Respawn is not just a team, they're a powerhouse in the sphere of advancement, creativity and obsession with the realm of gaming and technology. How do we stand out? Well to put it simply, we are in the gaming culture, advanced tech and solution search. Since our start we’ve been focusing on uniting people who share mutual love of games but at the same time use this motivation for actual projects that resolve problems on the ground. For this hackathon, we focused on our skills in coding, design, and strategy as well as our gaming expertise against the targeted challenges.

            Creative player comes up with a new plan! Strategy moved to a new level! Explosive Pixel! This was the exact reasoning every single member of Respawn was trained to have which allowed them to face any challenge thrown at them even if it meant thinking like a gamer: very strategic, quick, and creative. Speaking of reaching new heights, constructing gaming competitions, creating gaming inspired resources, and simply innovation has been an unwavering push we have had even in the hackathon. New day means new ideas and that is how we roll as gamers and creators. While working on our ideas we combine brainstorming, crafting, and implementing all while preserving the essence of being driven and having passion. Teamwork, decisiveness and being out of the box is what we believe contributed to our success so far.
